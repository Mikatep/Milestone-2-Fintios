-  Friends and family were asked to check the website and give feedback throughout the different steps of the process.

### Validator Testing 

-  Html
No errors were returned in any of the pages when passing through the official W3C validator.

A warning was returned reccomending to always add a header to every section however it has been ignored for designed purposes and to stay close to the original wireframe.

No errors were returned whe passing through the official Jigsaw validator.

### Unfixed Bugs

The main problem and bug encountered was the imposibility of taking data from one of the html pages (index) and store it to use it in the rest of the pages.

The JavaScript used for this has been deleted, but this is definitely an unsolved bug, which I'll make sure to fix by myself in the future with more time and knowledge available, since it will definitely add extra functiotanilty to the website.
